# Maximizing Revenue For Drivers Through Payment Type Analysis


## Problem Statement:

In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential from long-time success and driver happiness.

Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.



## Objective:
This Project main goal is run an Hypothesis test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python Hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. In particular we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.




## The Tasks involved in this project include:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Extracting The Information from the data**

**Outliers Detection**

**Removing Outliers**

**descriptive statistics**

**Normal Distribution Check**

**Hypothesis Testing**



## **Libraries:**

- **Python** for Programming.

- **Pandas** for Data Manipulation.

- **Seaborn** for Visualization.

- **Matplotlib** for Visualization.

- **Warnings** for Ignoring Warnings.

- **Scipy** for Testing.

- **Statsmodels** QQ-Plot.



### Insights:

- Understanding payment preferences helps businesses encourage higher-value payments **(credit cards)** through promotions.

- graphical depiction will offer a clear and intuitive understanding of the distribution between the two payment methods chosen by passengers.

- we can gain insights into potential variations in payment preferences across different passenger counts.

- This will also provide stakeholders with insight into fare amount ranges associated with different payment methods.

- The key business insight is that encouraging customers to pay with credit cards can generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.



### Recommendations:

- Encourage customers to pay with Credit cards to capitalize on the potential for generating more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
- Implement strategies such as offring incentives or discounts for credit card transactions to incentivize customers to choose this payment method.
- Provide seamless and secure credict card payment options to enhance customer convenience and encourage adoption of this preferred payment method.
